# GerberTools Eagle fix
GerberTools Eagle fix is small project which I developed for use with [Panelizer](https://github.com/ThisIsNotRocketScience/GerberTools/releases). If you export from new version of Eagle output format is not same as it was in a past and [Panelizer](https://github.com/ThisIsNotRocketScience/GerberTools/releases) would not recognise a board. My little python script renames files to correct names.

## How to use it
1. place `eagle_gerber_fix.py` in same folder as `CAMOutputs`. 
2. Run `eagle_gerber_fix.py`.
3. Done. Yours files were renamed and you can place them into [Panelizer](https://github.com/ThisIsNotRocketScience/GerberTools/releases)
